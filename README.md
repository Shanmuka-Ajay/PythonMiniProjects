Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic Python mini-projects designed to introduce beginners to the language and its various applications. Each project focuses on a specific concept or technique, providing hands-on experience with Python programming.

Prerequisites

To run these mini-projects, you will need:

Python 3.x or higher installed on your system
An integrated development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text (optional)
Instructions

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open each project directory and locate the corresponding Python script (e.g., main.py).

Use your IDE or terminal to run the script. For example, in the terminal, navigate to the project directory and type python main.py.

Follow the instructions or prompts provided in each project to complete the task.

Project List

The repository currently includes the following mini-projects:

Bagels: a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: 
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits.

The Birthday Paradox: also called the 
Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.


Additional mini-projects will be added to the repository in the future.
